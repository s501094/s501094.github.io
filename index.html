            <p>So far today, I am trying to connect WP-CLi to this WordPress site so that I can update everything via cli. At this point I'm not sure if this is possible, but it would make blogging easier if I could do it via bash terminal. So far, I have installed the WP-CLI into my wsl bash.

            <p>My new Ducky keyboard came in with the cherry mx black silent switches.

            <!--<h3><a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=5027&mkref=ttiena9"> Check it out here!</a></h3> -->


                Overall, I'm pretty happy with the product I got from Mechanical Keyboards. This keyboard is only a "segue" to the Varmilo keyboard coming at the end of July. 
                
                <h4><form action="https://en.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/subject_product_detailed?subjectid=57"><input type="submit" value="Check Out Keyboard" /></form></h4>

                Once that comes in, I may get a decal for my tower. Overall, the plan is to do a black and white theme with at most, little hints of green here and there. What fits better into a black and white theme than panda bears?!

            <p class='tab'>Friday was a scary day for me. I woke up as a normal day, though shortly after waking up is when it all went downhill. Heart was racing so fast I could feel it litterally beating out of my chest. </p>
